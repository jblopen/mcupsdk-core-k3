# Introduction

This is a remote core test application.The example is supported only on HS-SE device.
This example application is signed with auth type 2 (inplace varient type).The makefile contains the information of authentication type being used, this is passed to the signing script which generates the certificate and signs the application image.Based on the information in the certificate the system firmware does the authentication and decrypts the image.
